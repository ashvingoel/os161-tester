Installing os161-tester
-----------------------

1. Edit the "setup" file found in the "bin" directory to suit your needs. This
   file has an INSTALL_PATH path variable. All relative paths below are with
   respect to this path.

2. Run the following make command in this directory to setup the "os161-tester"
   and "results" directories in the INSTALL_PATH.

make

3. Get the roster file from UofT portal and save it in the results/roster.csv
   file.

- From Control Panel >> Course Tools > UT Manage Groups
- Click View/Download Selected Roster
- Check "Student ID" box.
- Check "Email" box.

4. Make sure that the roster.csv file has the following format. This format is
   used by the generate-mail command described below.

UTORiD,First Name,Last Name,Student Number,Email


Marking
-------
0. First get a copy of the assignment sources.

cd results/asst_nr
bin/get-src asst_nr

1. Run the following command for marking. This command will generate results in
   the current directory (i.e., results/asst_nr).

cd results/asst_nr
bin/os161-tester -m asst_nr

   You can keep the marker running in the background, even after you logout,
   by typing the following command:
   
nohup bin/os161-tester -m asst_nr &

2. After running the previous command, run the following command to generate a
   mailbox file that you can review. The mailbox file is called
   mail-asst_nr.mbox.

bin/generate-mail asst_nr

3. Use mutt (or your preferred mail client) to sanity check the emails

mutt -f mail-asst_nr.mbox

4. If everything looks good, email the results to the students. The following
command will breakup mail-asst_nr.mbox into one email file at a time and use
sendmail to email the file to each group.

bin/send-mail asst_nr

5. Use the get-diff program to generate patches. The program uses the sources
that were downloaded by the get-sources program. The patches can be checked
for similarity using moss, the stanford checker.

compare/get-diff asst_nr
compare/moss os-0[0-9][0-9].txt

   Run the linecompare program to see how many lines have exact matches in
   the different assignments. This program takes a long time to run.

compare/linecompare

   You can also use the aggregator program that gets the sources from svn. This
   program generates all files that have changed since the last assignment.

compare/aggregator asst_nr
compare/moss os-0[0-9][0-9].txt

6. Download csv files from grade center by clicking on "Work Offline" followed
   by "Download" for each lecture. For "Data", choose "Selected Column" and
   pick the appropriate assignment column (e.g., for lab 0 you would pick the
   equivalent column for lab 0). For "Options", choose "Comma" as your 
   "Delimiter Type" and "My Computer" for your "Save Location. Click on
   "Submit" followed by "Download" to download your file. Place all csv files
   under the appropriate asst_nr folder.
   
7. Run the following command for updating the csv files (replace asst_nr where
   appropriate)

cd results/asst_nr
bin/update-mark -n asst_nr *.csv

8. The script should tell you how many marks were updated, and how many students
   there are in total in all of the csv files combined (the two numbers should
   be equal). 
   
9. Upload the csv files by going the grade center and click on "Work Offline"
   followed by "Upload". Choose the correct csv file for the appropriate
   lecture section, and press "Submit". You will see a confirmation page
   which asks you which column(s) to update. Click "OK" to complete this step.
